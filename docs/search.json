    "text": "SIMPLE SCATTERPLOT\nOne thing to realize about professional hockey is that it is pretty rare for a player to play in the NHL right after being drafted. Players get drafted when they are 18 years old, and they usually play in the juniors, minor leagues, or the NCAA for a bit to further develop.\nBelow is a scatter plot to visualize this phenomenon with the most recent draft classes.\n\n\nCode\ndraft2022<-NHLDraft%>%\n  filter(draftyear==2022 & postdraft==0)\n\nggplot(draft2022, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs observed, the players drafted in June of 2022 haven’t played much this season. There are few things wrong with this visualization, however:\n\nOverplotting. All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you think of a way that adding extra channels might help?\nLabelling. Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualizaiton is intended to facilitate, as well as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.\nKey-Value pairs: Looks like we are using “round” as a continuous variable. Can we change this to an ordered factor?"

    "text": "EXPANDED SCATTERPLOT\nThe data from the most recent draft isn’t really helpful for our question. Therefore,it would be better to go back in time and use a draft year that has had some time to develop and reach their potential.\nHence, it will be better to use the 2018 data to achieve this purpose.\n\n\nCode\ndraft2018<-NHLDraft%>%\n  filter(draftyear==2018 & postdraft<6)\n\nggplot(draft2018, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of games played by drafted players in different round picks\",\n    x = \"round\",\n    y = \"NHLgames\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the problem of overplotting, we’ve got an additional issue here. We actually have two keys and one attribute. The attribute is NHLgames, and the keys are round and postdraft, but we are only using round.\nThere are options to explore here. A visualization that uses both keys could be made, or alternatively, summarize the data for one of the keys.\nThe figure before summarizes the data for the TOTAL number of NHL games played since being drafted.\n\n\nCode\ndrafttot2018<- draft2018%>%\n  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name)%>%\n  summarise(totgames=sum(NHLgames))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'playerId', 'round', 'overall', 'position'.\nYou can override using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=round, y=totgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=reorder(name,overall), y=totgames))+\n  geom_col(aes(fill=as.factor(round)))+\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = NULL)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total number of games played by drafted players\",\n    x = \"Overall draft position\",\n    y = \"Total games played\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best ways to deal with overplotting is to use our keys to SEPARATE and ORDER our data. Unlike in the scatterplots that had several overlaps that made it difficult to distinguish the variables in the data, the column chart above clearly shows the differences in the number of games players drafted in different rounds played using colour as an additional distinguishing factor."

I’ll eliminate all the players drafted in 2018 who never played an NHL game, leaving us 80 players drafted in that year who made “THE SHOW”. Let’s look at how those 80 players were drafted:\n\n\nCode\nplayedNHL2018 <- drafttot2018%>%\n  filter(totgames>0)\n\nggplot(playedNHL2018, aes(x = \"\", fill = factor(round))) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization is not great. In that, it is impossible to do a comparison between a player who has played hundreds of games in their first five years and one that has played one game in five years.\nConsidering the data type and size, a pie chart does not describe it adequately and thus makes it impossible to make good inferences of the variables from the visualization of which the relative value of second and third round picks are examples.\nLooking at the pie chart, it mainly talks describes size/ percentages. However, that is not the intended assessment being made hence making it inappropriate to use.\nI would say that at a glance the pie chart describes the number of players that were first round picks, second round picks, and so on. moreover, x and y axis of the pie chart illustrated above are redundant.\nChanging this to account for the various years post draft:\n\n\nCode\nseasonplayedNHL2018 <- draft2018%>%\n  filter(NHLgames>0)\n\n\nggplot(seasonplayedNHL2018, aes(x = \"\", fill = factor(round))) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\")+\n  facet_wrap(~postdraft)"

    "text": "CONCLUSION\nBased on the visualizations, I would advise that trading a first-round pick for two second-round picks and one third-round pick, although dicey, could be likened to shooting yourself in the foot.\nIn as much as the performance of first round picks are unquestionable, it is obvious that given the chance, second and third round picks, may also perform well if they have more play time postdraft. Moreover, Therefore the team is better off with a good number of players who can produce results rather than depending on one person to make the team perform better."

    "text": "PREAMBLE\nTravel is one thing people all over the world share in common usually for family, business or pleasure; be it local or international. Among the many modes of travel, the fastest and most convenient especially for longer distances is the airplane. However, in spite of the many contingencies put in place, the plane remains a machine which is prone to faults and unforeseen circumstances regardless of the efforts put in place.\nIn this assignment, I will analyze data incidents and number of fatal accidents for associated with each airline for about 30 years and attempt to make certain conclusions.\nCriteria for choice of parameters used in assessment:\nThe data set had several airlines so airlines with on average one incident per year or more in the period 1985-1999 and 2000-2014 were selected for analysis."

However, from the visualizations, it is clear that there has been and continues to be significant reduction in the number of incidences and fatal accidents. A great indication that there is robust improvement in the services and technology over the years and airlines are doing the utmost best to allay passenger fears, and get them to their destinations safely. The choice though, is totally a matter of preference!"

    "text": "The data used in this assignment is an existent dataset, available as a package (USArrests) in ‘R studio’ software. It provides information on violent crime rates by US state.

This grouped bar plot is the best (most effective) visualization because most importantly, the data set is ordered. in additon to that, it shows the variables (crimes) grouped per state as respresented in the data set for easy understanding.\nOn the other hand, Figure. 2, is an inappropriate visualization because it is not expressive and definetely not the most effective representation of the data. The idea is that at a glance the viewer should be able to understand the described data. And this does not meet that requirement.\nDiscriminability\nThis simply asks the question whether ‘differences in items are perceptible to the viewer as intended’. From Figure.1, we can see that the differences in crime rates across states are easily noticed and therefore quite a good represenation of discriminability.\nHowever, Figure. 2 does not explicitly meet that requirement by not showing the differences in variables clearly and thus, not a good visualization.\nSeparability\nThis emphasizes avoidance of ‘unanticipated combination’. In that, the viewer should be able to separate one channel from the other. In my understanding of this, Figure. 1 adequately represents this by separating the various variables from one state to the other.\nFigure. 2, however, does not do this. Rather, it seems to cram the variables together and does not exactly provide clear distinction among the variables.\nPopout\nThe description seeks to make the viewer see the clear differences in visualization of any given data set easily. In that, distinct items immediately stand out from the others.\nIn Figure. 1, the rates of various variables standout evidently at a a glance unlike in Figure.2 where the visualization confuses viewer on the message it intends portraying.\nTextbook Reference:\nMunzner, T.
