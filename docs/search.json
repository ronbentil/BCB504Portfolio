vector count (number of ticks per livestock), grouped per tick species below. This confirms that that the distribution of ticks on livestock varied among tick species.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(tickdata, aes(x=Vectorcount)) + \n    geom_bar(colour=\"blue\", fill=\"grey\", stat=\"count\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Species)+\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0))"
