Among the many modes of travel, the fastest and most convenient especially for longer distances is the airplane. However, in spite of the many contingencies put in place, the plane remains a machine which is prone to faults and unforeseen circumstances regardless of the efforts put in place.\n\nIn this assignment, I will analyze data incidents and number of fatal accidents for associated with each airline for about 30 years and attempt to make  certain conclusions.\n\nCriteria for choice of parameters used in assessment:\n\nThe data set had several airlines so airlines with on average one incident per year or more in the period 1985-1999 and 2000-2014 were selected for analysis. \n\n## DATA\nThe data set I will be using for my visualizations is an already existent data set package in R. \nSource:\n[Aviation Safety Network](https://r-data.pmagunia.com/dataset/airline-safety).\n\n\nA data dictionary has  been added to provide definitions for the various headers in the data set. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nairlinesafety=read.csv('Airline safety datset.csv', header =

for travel. However, from the visualizations, it is clear that there has been and continues to be significant reduction in the number of incidences and fatal accidents. A great indication that there is robust improvement in the services and technology over the years and airlines are doing the utmost best to allay passenger fears, and get them to their destinations safely. The choice though, is totally a matter of preference! ",
