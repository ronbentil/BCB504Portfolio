It provides information on violent crime rates by US state. The data set contains information on arrests for assault, murder, and rape in 6 six US states per 100,000 residents. It also provides information on  proportion of population living in urban areas.\nThis dataset provides originally provides information on 50 states. However, for the purpose of this assignment, I modified the data to use 6 states.

This grouped bar plot is the best (most effective) visualization because most importantly, the data set is ordered. in additon to that, it shows the variables (crimes) grouped per state as respresented in the data set for easy understanding. \n\nOn the other hand, Figure. 2, is an inappropriate visualization because it is not expressive and definetely not the most effective representation of the data. The idea is that at a glance the viewer should be able to understand the described data. And this does not meet that requirement.\n\n**Discriminability**\n\nThis simply asks the question whether 'differences in items are perceptible to the viewer as intended'. From Figure.1, we can see that the differences in crime rates across states are easily noticed and therefore quite a good represenation of discriminability. \n\nHowever, Figure. 2 does not explicitly meet that requirement by not showing the differences in variables clearly and thus, not a good visualization.\n\n**Separability**\n\nThis emphasizes avoidance of 'unanticipated combination'. In that, the viewer should be able to separate one channel from the other. In my understanding of this, Figure. 1 adequately represents this by separating the various variables from one state to the other. \n\nFigure. 2, however, does not do this. Rather, it seems to cram the variables together and does not exactly provide clear distinction among the variables.\n\n**Popout**\n\nThe description seeks to make the viewer see the clear differences in visualization of any given data set easily. In that, distinct items immediately stand out from the others.\n\nIn Figure. 1, the rates of various variables standout evidently at a a glance unlike in Figure.2 where the visualization confuses viewer on the message it intends portraying. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Textbook Reference:**\n\nMunzner, T.
