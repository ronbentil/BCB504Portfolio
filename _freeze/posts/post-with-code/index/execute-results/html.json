The data contains information on livestock and the ticks collected off them. The ticks were subsequently identified morphologically and the pathogens that these ticks harbored were identified using PCR on extracted nucleic acid.\n\n\nI'm putting this dataset together in response to \\[Assignment 2\\](https://professorpolymorphic.github.io/RobisonWebSite/BCB520/posts/A2-YourData/) from the \\[BCB 504\\](https://professorpolymorphic.github.io/RobisonWebSite/BCB520/BCB520.html) class.\n\n## Data collection\n\n\nThe data were collected from two parts of Ghana (Greater Accra in the South and Upper East in the North). Sampling sites were carefully chosen based on known climate and environmental conditions that influence arthropods and their ability to transmit pathogens.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\n\nThe following shows the basic formatting of the data file using the \\`glimpse()\\` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(tickdata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 706\nColumns: 15\n$ Date                 <chr> \"28/01/2020\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ `Field ID`           <chr> \"GVS-A-T-001\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ Location             <chr> \"Burma Camp\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ Animal               <chr> \"Cattle\", \"Cattle\", \"Cattle\", \"Cattle\", \"Cattle\",…\n$ AnimalSex            <chr> \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\",…\n$ `Age (years)`        <chr> \"4\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ BodyPart             <chr> \"Anal\", \"Anal\", \"Anal\", \"Anal\", \"Anal\", \"Anal\", \"…\n$ `Vector count`       <dbl> 10, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 2, NA, 3,…\n$ `Vector Sex`         <chr> \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"…\n$ `Lab ID`             <chr> \"T001\", \"T002\", \"T003\", \"T004\", \"T005\", \"T006\", \"…\n$ `RNA Extracted`      <chr> \"RNA1\", \"RNA2\", \"RNA3\", \"RNA4\", \"RNA5\", \"RNA6\", \"…\n$ Species              <chr> \"Hyalomma rufipes\", \"Hyalomma rufipes\", \"Hyalomma…\n$ `Rickettsia `        <chr> \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"…\n$ `Rickettsia africae` <chr> \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"…\n$ CCHFV                <chr> \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Negative\", \"…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that some of the Attributes have \\`NA\\` entries.
